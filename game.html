            You’re enjoying a delicious Bat’s Blood soup at the Great Hall when Harry Potter, holding a half-eaten treacle tart, approaches you looking somewhat uncomfortable. He sits down next to you and nervously says hello but shoves huge bits of his tart into his mouth before you get a chance to properly say hello back and ask how he is doing. You wave instead, looking at him expectantly. Harry puts down his fork, wipes his mouth, and looks back at you oddly.

            You’re a little surprised -- having seen Harry snog quite publicly with both Ginny and Cho, you’re not sure what to make of his new relationship with Seamus. The two of you continue to make some polite conversation until he excuses himself to go to Potions. You finish up your soup and neaten up your robes before picking up your History of Magic books. Oh! You realize, suddenly, that Harry was so nervous earlier because he was afraid you would react poorly. You shrug and pick up your rucksack. I wonder if I should tell him I like both witches and wizards too, you wonder.

            You’re a little startled by how quickly Potter scurried away. Not overly concerned and still ravenously hungry, you finish up your soup before picking up your History of Magic books to put in your rucksack for class. As you neaten up your robes and stand up, you realize that perhaps Harry had something important to tell you -- he was acting quite nervously, after all. What was it that he wanted to ask?

            <b>// about fictive //</b><br>
            <i>fictive</i> is a reimagining of the classic beloved <i>Harry Potter</i> story. Harry Potter, the eponymous character of the series, has always been unambiguously assumed to be straight. However, in many fanfiction adaptations of the novels, Harry is recast as queer, gender non-conforming, or sometimes even a POC. In fact, a major strength of fanfiction lies in its ability to create media representation and normalize underrepresented identities and experiences. We added a higher level of agency by turning traditional fanfiction into this text-based choose-your-own-adventure game -- now, you can actively control how the story ends based on how you want to respond, conversing with Harry to find out what exactly made him so nervous talk to you. Depending on what you say, his comfort level increments or decrements, and his responses could become more terse or relaxed. We carefully modeled our Harry after the novel’s Harry Potter, a nuanced character whose awkwardness and impetuousness is well-known, only changing one thing -- his sexuality.
            <br><br><b>// about your score //</b><br>
            The game tracks Harry's comfort level depending on how you respond to him—each response affects how he feels around you, much like
            a person would think and be affected by their surroundings.<br><br>
            <b>Harry's max comfort level is 16</b>—even if you were able to get Harry to tell you his secret, if you didn't get 11, some of your responses held
            biases or aroused feelings of discomfort. See if you can play again and recognize these responses and raise Harry's comfort level.
